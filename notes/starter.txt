1st starter for every micro service
=> create a folder 
=> create package.json and install dependencies 
=> create Dockerfile
=> create src folder and write index.ts 
=> Build Image and push to docker hub (push if want) 
=> write k8s file for deployment and service 
=> write k8s for mongodb deployment and service 
=> add the service to ingress-service
=> update skaffold for this service 

shortcuts - copy pasting
copy tsconfig .dockerignore  Dockerfile package.json 
and then src folder => test_folder(where special test code is located) 
index.ts and app.ts 
copy services folder and do required changes 
Must change name of the project in package.json
do yarn install
do the changes in the copied files to exclude errors 
create depl.yaml file and copy from previous micro-service and change the service names
update skaffold.yaml,  
create mongo-depl file and copy from previous micro service and change the service names 
go to src/test/setup.ts and change the global.signIn fn (auth service setup is changed than others 

//!!! We must used TDD approach 
//!!! All Images must be deployed to dockerhub when deploying the code 

packages 
typescript ts-node-dev express @types/express cors body-parser


TS
tsc --init -> to generate tsconfig.json
change in start script

Create a very first directory for any service like auth..
and just do some basics with any basic route.. 

then make a docker file for it and then build the file using valid tagname
then create ./infrastructure/k8s and on k8s - create depl file for 1st directory like auth

then on the main -- create Skaffold file and after configuring that file 
go to the terminal and do -- skaffold dev 

and then go to ./infrastructure/k8s and create ingress file 
and configure a specific path for 1st directory like for auth

and then host will be online 

then creating database deployment file like auth-mongo-depl
and then connect to database 

///!! after auth part is done, we will go to next js and implement that part   

yarn create next-app client  
tsc --init -> to generate tsconfig.json
follow the link to add ts --> https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript
after setting next js -- create Dockerfile and docker ignore file 
build and PUSH the image  (push it is not mandatory in dev mode (if not having good internet)) 
then we have 3 things to do, add this service in k8s depl file, ingress srv file and Skaffold 

//!! must run this on skaffold dev , not on local env

add next.config.js file
