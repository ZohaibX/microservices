This is nats-streaming-server / not nats -- both are different 

create nats-depl.yaml 
do configuration and go to skaffold and see if the deployment is created and working 
check it by kubectl get pods 

in the common module, we must have a base listener and a base publisher abstract classes 
and we will extend that classes in individual services as sub classes 
and we will use the subclasses to create instances

base-listener and base-publisher is full of documentation in common module 
we must have to define all the event channels in Subjects enum in common/src/events/helpers/Subjects
and for every channel, we must have an interface describing their behavior 

we could update channels and their interfaces time to time 

so we made create publishers methods like we did in tickets/events
and we  used them in new.ts and update.ts
